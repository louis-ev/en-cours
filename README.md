# do•doc

do•doc (or dodoc) is a documentation tool, first designed for use in classrooms with children. It is a platform connected to a physical device that operates a camera and a microphone, and enables one to capture traces from an on-going experience for later reflections, reconstructions and creation of narratives.<br> 
do•doc is made by [l'atelier des chercheurs](http://latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/) (Sarah Garcin, Pauline Gourlet & Louis Eveillard).<br>

# Install do•doc

### Method 1 — the easy way

Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/l-atelier-des-chercheurs/dodoc/releases).

### Method 2 — the long way

_You need [node.js version 8.9.3](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.9.3/) and [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) to install this app with this method. On Windows, you also need to install Microsoft’s Windows Build Tools by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#prerequisites)._

#### 1. Download this repository

Click on _Clone or Download_ in the top right corner of this page, then _Download ZIP_. Unpack this folder.

#### 2. Open a terminal window

Open a terminal window:

* Windows: (XP) use [this tutorial](http://wikistrea.fr/Comment_ouvrir_la_console_de_commande_Windows_en_mode_administrateur_%3F) to open a terminal on Windows or open Command Prompt in the start menu
* macOS: go to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
* Linux: use a terminal app such as Terminal or Konsole

In your terminal, navigate to the dodoc-master folder with your terminal using the `cd` command:

```
cd path/to/dodoc-master
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

If you haven’t already, install the tool that will enable native modules to be used. To do this, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp

Then, install _do•doc_’s dependencies (may take up to 5 minutes):

```
npm install
```

#### 4. Run do•doc

Start from the folder in a terminal window with the following command:

```
npm start
```

#### Troubleshooting

Most install errors (and especially the _Module version mismatch. Expected 50, got XX._) are due to native packages such as [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), a powerful image manipulation library.

**The first thing to check is whether you use the right version of node.js: it must be version 8.9.3.
To know the version you are running, write `node -v` in a terminal window.**

The reason you have to use this version of node.js is because this app uses Electron, a tool to package node.js and a webbrowser as native apps. The version of Electron this app is using is version 2.0.5, and it uses node version 8.9.3. However, when native modules are built, they are built using the local node version and not Electron’s. Hence, you have to run the exact same version as Electron to prevent this type of error to happen.

Because switching between node version is annoying, it is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to do so ([nvm windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows).

Here are a few other things you can try (but only after making sure you run the right node version):

1.  Sometimes, Electron is not installed when running `npm install` on the repo. It may help to run `npm install electron@2.0.5` just to be sure it is actually installed locally.

1.  Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md), and specifically:

```
# Electron's version.
export npm_config_target=2.0.5
# The architecture of Electron, can be ia32 or x64.
export npm_config_arch=x64
export npm_config_target_arch=x64
# Download headers for Electron.
export npm_config_disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron
# Tell node-pre-gyp that we are building for Electron.
export npm_config_runtime=electron
# Tell node-pre-gyp to build module from source code.
export npm_config_build_from_source=true
# Install all dependencies, and store cache to ~/.electron-gyp.
HOME=~/.electron-gyp npm install
```

3.  electron-builder (which builds electron to an app) embeds a script that rebuilds dependencies according to electron. To use it, write:

```
./node_modules/.bin/electron-builder install-app-deps
```

**sharp on ubuntu**

It seems the dependency sharp cannot be built easily on Ubuntu. Install an older version to fix this:

```
npm install sharp@0.17.3
```

# Tweak, fork and debug

### server-side

* Run `npm run debug` to start the server with a better debug in terminal

### client-side

The client-side code is in the `public` folder. To write some new CSS or client-side JS, you need to run the following tasks:

```
npm run install
```

and then, to start the dev tasks:

```
npm run dev
```

To build for production, use

```
npm run build
```

This will create minified JS files in the `public/dist` folder.
